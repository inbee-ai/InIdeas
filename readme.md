## Introduction

This project is focused on gathering ideas for new software projects that will be developed in Python, PHP, or Java. We are a team of developers and enthusiasts who use artificial intelligence to create innovative software solutions. Your ideas are important to us, and we want to turn them into real projects that can benefit the entire community.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork this repository**: Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of this page to create a copy of this repository on your GitHub account.
2. **Create a new idea**: Add a new idea to the `ideas` folder as a new Markdown (.md) file. Name the file according to your idea's title.
3. **Write a detailed description**: Make sure your idea includes all the necessary details (see [Idea Format](#idea-format)).
4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you're done, submit a Pull Request, and we'll review and possibly include your idea in the project.

## Idea Requirements

- **Originality**: The idea should be original and not a copy of existing projects.
- **Usefulness**: Focus on ideas that can have practical use and benefit users.
- **Feasibility**: Consider whether your idea is technically feasible and what resources would be needed for its implementation.

## Idea Format

When adding an idea to the `ideas` folder, please follow this format:

```markdown
# Idea Title

## Description

A brief and clear description of the idea. What will this software do? What problem does it solve?

## Key Features

- Feature 1
